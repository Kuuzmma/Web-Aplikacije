			<h2>Preseason 2022</h2>
			<p class="description">Preseason 2022 is right around the corner, and we are excited to introduce with it a brand new Inspiration Keystone: First Strike.</p>
			<p>First Strike is a new Inspiration Keystone that gives you a huge advantage when you strike an enemy champion first (or, technically, within a very short window time at the start of champion combat).</p>
			<p>Damaging an enemy champion with an attack or ability before they do, or within 0.25s of the start of combat, grants 5 gold and First Strike for 3 seconds, causing your attacks or abilities to deal 12% bonus damage against all champions, and granting (100% melee / 70% Ranged) of bonus damage dealt as gold.</p>
			<p>To get the most out of it, youâ€™ll need to beat your opponents in a test of reactions to get that initial hit and follow up to deal as much damage as possible during the 3-second buff. </p>
			<p>Cooldown of this keystone is between 25 and 15 secondes based on level of champion. It's designed for players who want more strategic, long-term output from their runes in addition to an immediate mechanical boost.</p>
			<h3>We removed <q>Omnistone</q></h3>
			<p>When one comes, the other goes. We removed first strike prototype Omnistone, which was never been popular.</p>
