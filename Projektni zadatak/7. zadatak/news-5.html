			<h2>TFT Patch 12.1 Notes</h2>
			<p class="description">12.1 is here, bringing quite a lot of changes for the new year, so what are you waiting for, let's get into it!</p>
			<p>We have a few more quality of life improvements to add. We added more value to trait-linked traits by pairing them with a free champion, gold, or emblems to equip on champions.</p>
			<p>Imperial comps seek to load up a carry with items and then have them 1v9; but currently, the trait is falling short. Our Imperial buff takes the most powerful use case of the trait, amplifying the multiplicative stats on an item loaded carry, and amps it up even more.</p>
			<p>All tiers of champions experienced some changes. The most changes are on tier 5 champions. Changed champions: Tier 1 - Caitlyn, Tier 2 - Swain, Tier 3 - Heimerdinger and Malzahar, Tier 4 - Seraphine and Urgot, Tier 5 - Galio, Kai'Sa and Tahm Kench.</p>
			<p>We prepared also some small changes. Smoke Bomb gave Assassins damage reduction towards the instance of damage that took them past the stealth threshold as a way to make sure they wouldn't get one-shot before the stealth activated. We're adding that hidden (stealthed?) feature to the tooltip and using it as a balance lever to give this trait a very small nerf. TL;DR, Smoke Bomb is microscopicly worse now.</p>
			<p>In items we have 1 change on Zz'Rot Portal. Zz'Rot Portal Health in stage1 through 4: 1500 (unchanged). Zz'Rot Portal Health in stage 5 through 7 changed from 1900 to 2100. Zz'Rot Portal Health in stage 8+ changed from 2250 to 2500.</p>
			<p>And of course like every patch we solved problems with bugs that we have noticed.</p>
