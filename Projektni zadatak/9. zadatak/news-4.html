			<h2>Season 2022</h2>
			<p class="description">Welcome to season 2022. We starting new ranked season with small reset on it, enjoy in the game!</p>
			<p>Diana and Gankplank get buffs to be a litle bit stroger. Rek'Sai and Sona get nerfs because they were to strong. But all nerfs and buffs we have done is for better experience for all.</p>
			<p>Now in shop you can find 2 new epic skins: Elderwood Rek'Sai and Elderwood Gnar. Price for each skin is 1350RP.</p>
			<p>We changed items for more balance in the game. Changed items: Eclipse, Wit's end, Immortal Shieldbow and Force of nature. Eclipse: EVER RISING MOON COOLDOWN (MELEE) changed from 6 seconds to 8 seconds. Wit's end: MAGIC RESIST changed from 50 to 40. Immortal Shieldbow: ATTACK DAMAGE changed from 55 to 50, LIFELINE SHIELD changed from 300-800 (based on level) to 275-650 (based on level). Force of nature ABSORB STACK DURATION changed from 5 seconds to 7 seconds, DISSIPATE MAGIC DAMAGE REDUCTION changed from 20% to 25%.</p>
			<p>Summoner spell Teleport changed. TELEPORT COOLDOWN changed from 420-210 seconds (based on level) to 360 seconds at all levels. UNLEASHED TELEPORT Teleport can only be used on allied towers. Once tower plating falls at 14 minutes, Teleport transforms into Unleashed Teleport (with 240 seconds Cooldown), which can target allied towers, minions, wards, and certain allied constructs (same as Season 2021 Teleport) </p>
			<p>The Summoner's Rift Ranked Season 2022 begins on Friday, 07 January 2022! All ranked accounts will receive a soft reset of 5 tiers for initial seeding. For example, Platinum I will become Gold II.</p>
			<p>Ranked Armor has transformed into Ranked Crests! Your rank fresh new look is in your profile, ranked page, game lobby, and friends list. Depends on how you end last season you will get Ranked Creats unique for every rank.</p>
